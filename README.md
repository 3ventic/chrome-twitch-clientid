# Twitch Client ID Injector

A browser extension that injects client ID and/or authorization headers to Twitch API requests, allowing developers to browse GET endpoints easily using the browser.

## Supported browsers

Despire being called chrome-twitch-clientid, the extension is not exclusive to Chrome, and works on these browsers:

* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/twitch-client-id-injector/)
* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitch-client-id-injector/okebcaancimcjdklkimjgcpcamnbkhli?hl=en)*

*Google have decided to discontinue webRequest in Manifest V3 and the API replacing it does not allow injecting headers, only removing them. As such, Chrome will no longer be getting any updates and this extension will stop working as they end-of-life Manifest V2.
